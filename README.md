# Cokol_XX

This is a repository dedicated to all relevant code for use with the Cokol-XX rocket series, capable of VTVL by means of standard rocket motor thrust vectoring systems (TVS).

This rocket is unique because it is a water rocket, uses only pressurized air to compress and force out the reactant, water.
